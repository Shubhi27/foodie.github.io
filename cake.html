<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Chocolate Biscuit Cake</h3>
<p>Line an 8-inch (20 cm) round pan* with high sides with plastic with plastic wrap ensuring that there is an overhang around the sides.<br>
Break up the digestive biscuits into pieces and place into a large bowl. I typically break each biscuit into about 6 pieces.<br>
Add about 1/2 - 1 inch (1-2 cm) of water to a medium saucepan over low-medium heat and place a glass bowl overtop (ensuring that the bottom of the bowl isn't touching the water) to create a double boiler.<br>
Add the chopped chocolate and butter to the glass bowl, and gently stir the mixture together until it is fully melted.<br>
Remove the glass bowl from the heat and whisk in the golden syrup and heavy cream.<br>
Pour the chocolate over the biscuits and stir until they're covered.<br>
Pour/spoon the mixture into the cake pan and smooth the top. Place in the fridge for at least 4 hours to set.<br>
<h3>Chocolate Ganache Topping</h3>
Finely chop the chocolate and place in a heat-proof bowl.
Warm the cream until almost boiling (either in the microwave or a saucepan while gently stirring).<br>
Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for 2-5 minutes.<br>
Whisk until smooth. If the chocolate isn't completely melted, microwave the bowl on medium power (not high or standard power) for 45 seconds and whisk until smooth.<br>
Remove the cake from the fridge. Lift it out of the pan using the overhang from the plastic wrap. Peel back the plastic and place the cake on a plate.<br>
Spoon the ganache over the cake and smooth the top. Return to the fridge to let the ganache set.<br>
